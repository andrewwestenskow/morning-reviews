# Week 7, Day 2 Review - Advanced Javascript Review

Depending on how well students were able to conceptualize the topics from this lecture, it may make sense to use a combination of the following exercises as part of this morning review. As always, before jumping in, ask for any questions. Try to structure the review around their questions, making sure to touch on any points they ask about. I find it helpful to write down all of their questions at the start and work from there.

## Important Concepts to Review

1. Asyncronous Functions
2. Promise-based Requests

## Review

Option #1: In case they may want some extra practice on these JavaScript Topics
    - Use this repl to go over concepts with them: https://repl.it/@matias_perez/Advanced-JavaScript-Morning-Review

Option #2:
    - Review async functions vs promised-based functions in JavaScript for first 10-15 minutes
    - Use the rest of time to allow students to ask questions and to begin working on the following full stack debugging practice on their own. I have found that this practice is much more helpful for the students to try to struggle through on their own, before walking through the debugging exercise together. 
    
> Please note that for starting this practice, students will need to fork and clone [this repo](https://github.com/LucasSchaat/how_meme_full_stack_app) and will need to create a .env file for storing their SERVER_PORT, CONNECTION_STRING and SESSION_SECRET. They will also want to use the init.sql file to setup their database and may want to add a couple examples in the database directly so that they can see some data show up when they get the code functioning properly.
>
> Also, it may be necessary to update the massive connection based on the deprecation warning. This file was created before the update to the massive package.
> 
> Also, please note that the finished version of this file can be found by looking at the changes that were made to the file with the latest commit (i.e., "Intentionally added bugs for debugging practice")
